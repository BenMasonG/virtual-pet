The aim of this project is to create a virtul pet. The user will be able to name the pet, see it age, walk it, feed it and talk to it to discover it's needs. As the pet ages it will get hungier and less fit and can die if it is not fed or walked. The pets will die at 30 days old.
The project will be built using java-script and will run in the console.
